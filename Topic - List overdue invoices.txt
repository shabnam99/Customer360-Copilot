        Summarize these overdue invoices clearly:

        JSON Data:
        {Topic.overdueinvoicesjson}

        Instructions:
        - Start by summarizing total invoices and total amount like: "3 invoices are overdue totaling $4,500".
        - Then list each invoice (avoid duplicate invoices) as a bullet point in this format:
        "CustomerName — InvoiceId — DueDate — $Amount"
        - Format dates as "MMM dd, yyyy" (e.g., Sep 18, 2025).
        - If there are no overdue invoices, simply respond: "No overdue invoices found."
